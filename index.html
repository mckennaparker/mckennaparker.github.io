                        <h3>Camp Kesem</h3>
                        <p>Camp Kesem is a one-week summer camp for children ages 6 - 18 whose parents have been affected by cancer. Throughout the school year I was involved with the Accessibility and Accountability Committee, planning and running two DEI workshops, which impacted 50+ members and counselors. This summer, I will be a counselor for the Gold Unit, which serves 16- to 18-year-olds.</p>

                        <p>I've played sports throughout my life, so coming to Penn I knew I wanted to stay active through club sports. I joined the ultimate frisbee team and played on the B team this past year.</p>

                        <p>This past year, I joined the Women in Computer Science Advocacy Committee. My main work with the club was based around the Percentage Project, which is a nationwide non-profit working to bring awareness to the experiences of minority groups in computing. I will be the Advocacy Committee Co-Director and Percentage Project Campus Director for Penn this upcoming year.</p>
